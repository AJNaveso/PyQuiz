# PyQuiz
PyQuiz is an interactive quiz game built with Python. The aim was to create and application and learn the basics of python GUI programming with TKinter. As I explored Tkinter more, I thought of developing this simplest game.

The PyQuiz opens up with multiple choice questions and increments your score with 5 as you answer correctly in the game and reduces 5 points for every incorrect answer. It also asks you for your confirmation while exiting the application.
