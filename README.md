# PyQuiz
PyQuiz is an interactive quiz game built with Python. The aim was to create and application and learn the basics of python GUI programming with TKinter. As I explored Tkinter more, I thought of developing this simplest game.

The PyQuiz opens up with multiple choice questions and increments your score with 5 as you answer correctly in the game and reduces 5 points for every incorrect answer. It also asks you for your confirmation while exiting the application.

Release: v0.2 
29th September, 2017.

## Installation

To install PyQuiz! to your system,

`sudo pip install py-quiz`

## Things To-Do:

* Resize Window as per question length. ( If somebody can help me with this, it'll be great!)
